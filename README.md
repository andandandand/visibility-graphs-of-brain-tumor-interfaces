# Visibility graphs of brain tumor interfaces #

Mathematica code to produce visibility graphs in "Tumor Growth in the Brain: Complexity and Fractality" by Miguel Martín-Landrove1, Antonio Brú, Antonio Rueda-Toicen & Francisco Torres-Hoyos, to appear in Springer's "The Fractal Geometry of the Brain", editor: Antonio Di Ieva.

We propose the use of a solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem to define an ordering of distances from the mass center of the tumor. This ordering is used to produce a synthetic "time" series from which the Hurst exponent can be calculated. The visibility graph of the tumor's interface is also produced accoding to this ordering.
