Mathematica code to produce visibility graphs in [**"Tumor Growth in the Brain: Complexity and Fractality"**](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-1-4939-3995-4_22 "Chapter at Springer") by Miguel Martín-Landrove, Antonio Brú, Antonio Rueda-Toicen & Francisco Torres-Hoyos, chapter 22 of Springer's [**"The Fractal Geometry of the Brain"**](http://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781493939930), editor: Antonio Di Ieva.

We propose the use of a solution of the Travelling Salesman Problem to define an ordering of walks from the center of mass of the tumor. This ordering is used to produce a synthetic "time" series from which the Hurst exponent can be calculated. The visibility graph of the tumor's interface is also produced considering this ordering.
